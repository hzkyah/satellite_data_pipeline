# Timeseries geospacial data of cloud covarage to help estimate energy generation capacity of roof-top solar panels

Uses satellite data to build cloud cover history of geolocations for capacity planning of roof-top solar panels.

## Project Idea 

This project is especially concerned with collecting historical cloud coverage data of spacially high resolution data points. 

## Tech Stack

Python + S3 + Spark + WebGL

Kafka/stream

Spark

WebGL

S3


## Data Source

Landsat 8

Sentine-2

Google earth engine 

Planet API

## Engineering Challenge

Efficient processing of rastrer satellite images to extract useful metadata features and pipelining this for data exploration.

Possible timestamp crunching/accelerating of stale data.


## Business Value

Energy harvest capacity predition.
Energy demand estimation.

## MVP

A web app presentation of timeseries cloud data for roof-top solar panels (their potential geolocations) on a section of San Fransico.

## Stretch Goals

General purpose realtime satellite data extraction and presentation/query system from a live stream of satellite data.
