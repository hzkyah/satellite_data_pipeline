# Roof-top solar panel and cloud variation detection
Uses realtime satellite data to identify roof-top solar panel objects and cloud coverage variation.

## Project Idea 
This project is especially concerned with identifying roof-top solar panels from satellite imagery and associating this with data of their surrounding sun light exposure intensity. 

## Tech Stack


## Data Source
The data source for detecting roof-top solar panels will be Google earth engine while the data for cloud variaiton will be from Planet.com 

## Engineering Challenge


## Business Value


## MVP


## Stretch Goals
General purpose realtime object detection and query system from a live view of satellite video stream.
